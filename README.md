### Install Dependencies
- run the command `npm install` in the project root.

### Setup environment variables
- create a local file `.env` using `example.env` as a template.
  - `.env` is listed in the `.gitignore` file and thus will not be added to Git's source control
  - populate this new `.env` file with the required values for your local machine

  # Running the Server:

  - `npm run server-dev`
